                <hr class="rule">
                <p>Dental implants are artificial tooth roots that are surgically placed into the jawbone to support a replacement tooth or bridge. They are made of biocompatible materials such as titanium, and provide a strong and stable foundation for a natural-looking and functioning tooth restoration.</p>
