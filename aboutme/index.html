    <h2>Barboza</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Luciano, but my friends call me Barboza. I am studying applied technology (Web Development). I am married to Valeria, a wonderful wife and we are parents of 2 kids, 
        Beatriz, my 20-year-old daughter and Bernardo, my 18-year-old son. Bernardo will be going 
        to his mission in East Santiago next january 16th. We are excited about this. </p>
    <p>I am from the south of Brazil, the capital of the state of Parana. I am a dentist, specialized in dental implants and periodontology. I am currently the ward pianist. I love to play music on my free time and to study. That`s why I decided to take the Pathway Course and enroll in this course in an area of my pleasure. I am excited to continue learning from the course and also from my BYU mates.  </p>
